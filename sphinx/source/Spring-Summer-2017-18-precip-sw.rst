High water demand as dry conditions take hold
---------------------------------------------
Freshwater demand in Canterbury was high from late October because of declining soil moisture levels, caused by very dry conditions.  The dry conditions have already featured in media stories in November and December.

Environment Canterbury is now receiving daily data updates from 97 per cent – by volume – of consented water use in Canterbury.  The data is coming in from 4500 individual water takes through automated telemetry systems.

Surface take restrictions for irrigation
----------------------------------------
No monitored river sites went below their “minimum flow” (the level at which Environment Canterbury restricts takes to protect ecological values) during October.  A small number of sites, however, came under restriction during November. More sites have come onto restriction in December as the dry spell lengthens.

The restrictions are posted daily on our `website <https://www.ecan.govt.nz/data/irrigation-restrictions/>`_. Consent holders get daily text messages telling them whether their take is restricted or not.

Key messages for the farming and urban community
------------------------------------------------
- Water consents are monitored to ensure sustainable use of the resource.
- Any misuse or breach of consent conditions, either detected or reported, will be dealt with through our compliance regime (written warning, abatement, infringement, prosecution).
- Farmers are urged to contact Environment Canterbury if they have an issue or a question around current or allowable water use.
- Irrigation will still be able to continue in many areas using water that doesn’t deplete streams or rivers: e.g. water from storage (lakes or ponds), deep groundwater, or from alpine rivers.
- In urban areas water use is managed by the city or district council, subject to consents issued by Environment Canterbury. Residents are being encouraged to be careful with water use, particularly over the hot dry summer.
