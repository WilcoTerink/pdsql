Groundwater levels and forecast
----------------------------------
Groundwater levels, monitoring well on Miners Rd, West MeltonGroundwater levels have begun to drop after strong recharge over the winter. They remain at average levels for the time of year across most of Canterbury. Levels have now recovered even in most of the deeper wells in the upper Canterbury Plains, though theyâ€™re also starting to be drawn down again by irrigation takes.  Groundwater levels remain below average in the Waipara basin.

We expect that the healthy groundwater levels should last the summer, and flows in groundwater-fed streams should also be in good shape. However, this could change if the weather remains very dry and irrigation takes are high.
